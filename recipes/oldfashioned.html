    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>When you get right down to it, the Bourbon <strong>Old Fashioned</strong> is little more than a slug of whiskey, seasoned and sweetened. Yet for all of its suave simplicity, the drink remains as relevant today as it was when it first captured drinkersâ€™ hearts 200 years ago. </p>

        <li>1/2 teaspoon sugar</li>
        <li>3 dashes Angostura bitters</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon water</li>
        <li>2 oz bourbon</li>
        <li>orange peel garnish</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
